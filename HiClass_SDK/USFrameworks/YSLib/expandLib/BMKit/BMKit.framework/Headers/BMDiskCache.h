/**
 `BMDiskCache` is a thread safe key/value store backed by the file system. It accepts any object conforming
 to the `NSCoding` protocol, which includes the basic Foundation data types and collection classes and also
 many UIKit classes, notably `UIImage`. All work is performed on a serial queue shared by all instances in
 the app, and archiving is handled by `NSKeyedArchiver`. This is a particular advantage for `UIImage` because
 it skips `UIImagePNGRepresentation()` and retains information like scale and orientation.
 
 The designated initializer for `BMDiskCache` is <initWithName:>. The <name> string is used to create a directory
 under Library/Caches that scopes disk access for this instance. Multiple instances with the same name are *not*
 allowed as they would conflict with each other.
 
 Unless otherwise noted, all properties and methods are safe to access from any thread at any time. All blocks
 will cause the queue to wait, making it safe to access and manipulate the actual cache files on disk for the
 duration of the block.
 
 Because this cache is bound by disk I/O it can be much slower than <BMMemoryCache>, although values stored in
 `BMDiskCache` persist after application relaunch. Using <PINCache> is recommended over using `BMDiskCache`
 by itself, as it adds a fast layer of additional memory caching while still writing to disk.
 
 All access to the cache is dated so the that the least-used objects can be trimmed first. Setting an optional
 <ageLimit> will trigger a GCD timer to periodically to trim the cache with <trimToDate:>.
